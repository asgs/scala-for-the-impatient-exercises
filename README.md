# What is it? #

This repo is an ongoing attempt at solving the problems given in the book "Scala for the Impatient". This is purely meant to be a learning exercise, probably to try out Scala as a language.

## Dependencies ##

None yet. I'm still learning!

## Building ##

It uses [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org) as the build tool, so all you have to do is execute `sbt run`.
